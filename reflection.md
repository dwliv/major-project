# Major Project Reflection

## What advice would I give myself?

- Have a clear idea of what I want to do before immediatly jumping in and getting stuck.
- Spend more time on the game itself and not the title screen and graphics.
- Spend more time on the physics as they're kinda weird.

## Was everything in needs to have complete?

- Yes, I got everything done and even got something in my nice to have list.

## The hardest part?

- Probably the flagpole as it wasn't displaying cuz I was making a silly mistake and it took me maybe 2 class periods to figure it out.
- Finding good images was kinda hard as some images on google wasn't having what I wanted.
- Trying to keep the code tiny as everything was all over the place for me.

## Any problems I couldn't solve

- I ran into many problems but I did manage to solve them all.
- Whenever I had an idea I made sure I completed it.
- I wouldn't call this a problem but I didn't manage where you can interact with blocks as I didn't have enough time to make that happen.
