# Project Description

- What I am going to build is a level of New Super Mario Bros for the Nintendo DS in 2006. Just a basic level from world one is what I will try to build. The game is about avoiding enemies, getting star coins (not required), getting power-ups and defeating bowser and saving the princess and the mushroom kingdom. While building this game I hope I canpush my knowledge of coding further than what is taught in the CS30 curriculum
